ChatPlugin uses a custom class loader to load the plugin's and its libraries' classes. If all the libraries were included in the plugin's JAR, its size would have been something like ~25 MB. However by default no external libraries are required (except the database connector one): they are downloaded only if you enable certain modules, like, for example, the Discord integration or the IP lookup.
