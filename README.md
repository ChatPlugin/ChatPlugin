ChatPlugin is a powerful and modular plugin that allows you to customize your server's appearance by modifying the chat's and the tablist's format, adding bossbars and scoreboards and much more.
It also offers several modules to make server administration easier for Staff members, like the punishments system and the account check module.

Please note that the plugin is **not** production-ready yet; fixing bugs is a priority, but use it at your own risk.
