ChatPlugin is a highly customizable and modular plugin that lets you personalize not only the chat, but many other aspects of your server as well.
It also offers several Staff modules to make server administration easier. Here are some of its features:
- lightweight and standalone: the plugin is built on a fully modular system for maximum performance
- 100% configurable and translatable: multiple custom languages are supported and everything can be translated
- easy to use: setup is simple and the [wiki](https://remigio07.me/chatplugin/wiki) offers comprehensive explanations for every module's configuration

A complete list of features is available [here](https://remigio07.me/chatplugin/wiki/getting-started/Features).

A premium version (an addon of the free version) will be released soon.
